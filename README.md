# clojureve

The clojureve project a collection of APIs and utilities for working with and analyzing data from the game Eve Online. It's objectives are the following:

1. Provide a Clojure wrapper around the Eve Online player API (web services).
2. Provide easy access to the stream of Market data coming from the [Eve Market Data Relay](https://eve-market-data-relay.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).
3. Analysis tools built on top of 1 & 2.
4. A web UI for end-user tools.

The initial goal is to be able to analyze market data in certain target regions along with the player's manufacturing abilities, blueprints, and possibly even materials, and recommend what the most profitable goods to manufacture might be. Unlike other sites which aggregate market data, this will be more player-focused, helping the capsuleer make better manufacturing and industrial decisions.
